# git init
The `git init` command is used to create an empty git respository.
If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[Status](./Status.md)
[add](./Commit.md)
[commit](./Commit.md)
[push](./push.md)
and more.
Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapuslate all content, including other directories.
